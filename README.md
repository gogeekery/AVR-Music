# AVR-Music
Circuits and code for making music with an Atmel MCU.

The folder labeled "simple" features simple square wave generated music on a single channel. Music is compact and easily added.

The folder labeled "advanced" includes synthesized audio, simulating chords played on a stringed instrument. It allows more than one channel.

The audio is output using the PWM output pins and a small (sub 1 watt 8 ohm) speaker.

Circuits for the different music generation techniques are not the same, so keep that in mind!
